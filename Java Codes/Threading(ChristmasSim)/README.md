The Elf.java file defines the Elf class, which represents an elf in a Santa scenario. Each elf has a state, which can be WORKING, TROUBLE, or AT_SANTAS_DOOR. The class implements the Runnable interface, allowing each elf to run in a separate thread.

Elves have a random 1% chance of encountering trouble each day while working. When three or more elves are in trouble, they change their state to AT_SANTAS_DOOR. The report() method is used to report the state of an elf.

The Reindeer.java file defines the Reindeer class, which represents a reindeer in a Santa scenario. Each reindeer has a state, which can be AT_BEACH, AT_WARMING_SHED, or AT_THE_SLEIGH. The class implements the Runnable interface, allowing each reindeer to run in a separate thread. Reindeers have a random 10% chance of returning from the beach to the warming shed when it's December. The report() method is used to report the state of a reindeer.

The Santa.java file defines the Santa class, which represents Santa in a Santa scenario. Santa has a state, which can be SLEEPING, READY_FOR_CHRISTMAS, or MEETING_REINDEER. The class implements the Runnable interface, allowing Santa to run in a separate thread. Santa wakes up and checks the situation when either three or more elves are waiting at his door or all reindeers have returned from their vacation. Depending on the situation, Santa changes his state accordingly. The report() method is used to report the state of Santa.

SantaScenario.java kicks off the main code involving Santa, elves, and reindeers. The main method initializes the Santa scenario by creating a Santa object, along with a list of Elf objects and a list of Reindeer objects. Each of these objects runs in a separate thread. The scenario progresses day by day for a total of 500 days, with an option to mark the month as December after a certain number of days. The state of Santa, the elves, and the reindeers is reported each day. After 370 days, the threads are stopped using deferred termination.
