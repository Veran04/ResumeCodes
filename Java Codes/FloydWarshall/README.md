This file implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. The program reads input data from a file, constructs an adjacency matrix representing the graph, and uses the algorithm to calculate the shortest paths for all vertex pairs. The algorithm iterates through the matrix, comparing and updating weights for all paths. After performing the calculations, the results are output to a separate file with each shortest path weight arranged in a 2D matrix format.
