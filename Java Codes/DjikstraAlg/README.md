 The program reads input data from a file, constructs an ArrayList of lists containing Edge objects (representing weighted connections between vertices), and calculates the shortest path from a specified source vertex to all other vertices. The algorithm is performed using a priority queue and updates the shortest path and parent vertices accordingly. After performing the calculations, the results are output to an output file containing the number of vertices, along with the shortest path weight and parent vertex for each destination vertex.
